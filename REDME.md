### Introduction
Hey! thanks for learning about git. This will help you in your careers. Designers thanks for coming along, I swear this will be relevant for you too.

I am _very_ ewxcited to see what you build on GitHub.

```php

    echo 'Coding is a fun career!';

```

## Branches
This project contains 3 types of branches. Master is used for the production branch, Dev is where we add new features, and new branches will be created to resolve our issues

Never work directly on MASTER, EVER, OR ELSE!
